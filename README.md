# 31github - My 31 Days Challenge Repository
Welcome to the "31github" repository, my hub for a 31-day coding challenge! In this challenge, I will be working on various projects that incorporate the MuzUStandard library. The goal is to experiment with and explore the different ways I can utilize this library to create exciting projects that sync visuals with music.

## About MuzUStandard
MuzUStandard is a powerful library designed for reading MuzU files. A MuzU file is a JSON-based format used to convey musical information to a computer. It serves as a foundation for synchronizing visuals with music, allowing me to dive into the realm of audiovisual creativity.

## Challenge Details
- Day 1 - Preparing MuzUStandard library and MuzU files
- Day 2 - Learning Prism: Simple Prism Application 
- Day 3 - Learning Prism: Modulization with Prism
