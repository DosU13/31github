# 31github - My 31 Days Challenge Repository
Welcome to the "31github" repository, my hub for a 31-day coding challenge! In this challenge, I will be working on various projects that incorporate the MuzUStandard library. The goal is to experiment with and explore the different ways I can utilize this library to create exciting projects that sync visuals with music. 

Yeah, Initially, I was motivated to achieve my goals, but lately, I've found myself primarily focused on solving Leetcode problems. Lazy me))). It seems that I set ambitious goals for myself at the beginning.

## About MuzUStandard
MuzUStandard is a powerful library designed for reading MuzU files. A MuzU file is a JSON-based format used to convey musical information to a computer. It serves as a foundation for synchronizing visuals with music, allowing me to dive into the realm of audiovisual creativity.
