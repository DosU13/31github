# 31github - My 31 Days Challenge Repository
Welcome to the "31github" repository, my hub for a 31-day coding challenge! In this challenge, I will be working on various projects that incorporate the MuzUStandard library. The goal is to experiment with and explore the different ways I can utilize this library to create exciting projects that sync visuals with music.

## About MuzUStandard
MuzUStandard is a powerful library designed for reading MuzU files. A MuzU file is a JSON-based format used to convey musical information to a computer. It serves as a foundation for synchronizing visuals with music, allowing me to dive into the realm of audiovisual creativity.

## Challenge Details
Throughout the 31 days, I will be creating new MuzU files and conducting experiments to see how I can effectively use the MuzUStandard library in various contexts. The challenge is an opportunity to enhance my coding skills, learn more about music visualization, and inspire others with my creative projects.
